# MVCC
## in transaction isolation level REPEATABLE READ (mysql default)
> # MVCC in innodb:
> ## when selecting:
  > only the version of one row is less than or equal to the txn version can be selected,
  > this ensures that either this row existed before this txn or this row is created or modified by this txn
  > the deletion version must be undefined or great than the txn version,
  > this ensures that the row wasn't deleted before this txn
> ## when inserting:
> innodb records the current system version number with the new one
> ## when deleting:
> innodb records the current system version number as the rows's deletion ID
> ## when updating:
> using the system version number for the new row's version,
> and writes the system version number as the old row's deletion version
